Development Sprints, also known as just 'sprints', are an unstructured session where attendees can work on projects with peers, hack on things, or see what others are working on.

PyCon AU will provide the space, power, and internet, you provide the projects.

Morning and afternoon tea will be provided, but lunch will not. Just across the way from the Convention Centre is Harbourside, a shopping complex that has mulitple foodcourts and restaurants.

Development Sprints tickets are available on our [tickets page](/attend/tickets) while availability lasts. You can buy these separately from your main conference ticket, but please make sure you enter the same Attendee name as your main ticket.
